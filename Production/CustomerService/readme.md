The API:
The API will be a REST or GraphQL endpoint which will be responsible for accepting requests from users or other services. The API will not directly interact with the database. Instead, it will communicate with the Consumer through Kafka and gRPC.

In the case of Kafka, the API will act as a producer. It will push events into the Kafka queue which the Consumer can pick up and process.

In the case of gRPC, the API can make direct calls to the Consumer to perform CRUD operations. Here, the API acts as a gRPC client, making requests to the gRPC server which is run by the Consumer.

The Consumer:
The Consumer is responsible for interacting with the database. It will run a gRPC server to allow the API to make requests for CRUD operations.

In addition, the Consumer will also listen to the Kafka queue for events produced by the API. Once it picks up an event, it will process it and make the necessary updates to the database.

In summary:

The API acts as a Kafka producer and a gRPC client.
The Consumer acts as a Kafka consumer and a gRPC server.
This separation allows for better scalability. You can independently scale your API and Consumer depending on the load. Additionally, by separating the database interaction to the Consumer, the API is kept stateless which allows for better performance and scalability.

As for where these go:

Your gRPC client code will go in the API part of each service. This is because your API is calling the gRPC server which is running in the Consumer part.
Your gRPC server code will go in the Consumer part of each service. The server will handle incoming gRPC requests and interact with the database to perform the necessary CRUD operations.
Your Kafka producer code will go in the API part of each service. The API is producing events to the Kafka queue for the Consumer to process.
Your Kafka consumer code will go in the Consumer part of each service. The Consumer is listening to the Kafka queue for events to process and update the database.F
